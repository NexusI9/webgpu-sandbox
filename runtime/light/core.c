/* =============================== SHADOW PROCESS ==============================
  Shadows use a Shadow Map approach. Meaning that they render multiple
  time the scene but under various view angles (each lights angles) to generate
  Depth Maps.
   1.Point light use a Cube Shadow Map: meaning that we will use
   our point light as a cube rendering 6 times ou scene with different angles
   2. For Spot light use Cascade Shadow Map

   To Generate the Depth Map we only require a Vertex Shader (no Fragment) as to
  only traslate the vertices under the light projection point of view

  We will then store those Depth Maps in each lights as TextureView
  and Sampler
  Once our Depth Map are stored we can finally use them in our "base" shaders

                          |
                   Light Projection
                    (cube/cascade)
                          |

                  * Render pass 1 *

                          |
                  Generate Depth Map
                          |
                    Store Depth Map

                  Bind Depth Texture
                          |
                    Compare with
                      Fragment
